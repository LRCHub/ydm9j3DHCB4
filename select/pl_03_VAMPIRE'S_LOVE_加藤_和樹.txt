The dazzling smile was just
beyond my reach
How sweet and innocent you were
If I could cross my night into
the sun
All my words to you, I still
wonder what I say
Stray dream of you lights the
chain of stars to find their way
in the darkest night of my lost
and frozen heart
lonely heart
Even if things don’t change
mm…
So the shadow’s dark would
cloud up clear skies
I watched over you, hid me in
the dark from you
Stray dream of you lights the
chain of stars to find their way
in the darkest night of my lost
and frozen heart
Even now Even now
More than the world
and more than life
still you’ve been so dear
You won’t be harmed
My words to you gently whispered
through the window pane
They just fade away from my
lips, I love you
Stray dream of you lights the
chain of stars to find their way
in the darkest night of my lost
and frozen heart
