The dazzling smile was
just beyond my reach
How sweet and innocent you were
If I could cross my night
into the sun
All my words to you,
I still wonder what I'd say
Stray dream of you
lit the chain of stars
to find the way
In the darkest night
of my lost and frozen heart
Long ago...
Even if things don't change...
uh...
So the shadow's dark
won't cloud your clear skies
I watched over you,
hidden in the dark from you
Stray dream of you
lights the chain of stars
to find the way
In the darkest night
of my lost and frozen heart
Even now... Even now...
More than the world
and more than life
to me you're so dear
You won't be hurt
My words to you,
gently whispered
through the windowpane
They just fade away
from my cold lips -
'I love you'
Stray dream of you
lights the chain of stars
to find the way
In the darkest night
of my lost and frozen heart
Even now...
